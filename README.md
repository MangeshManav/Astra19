Face Shields For Frontliners
* 
Face shield provides protection of the facial area and associated mucous membranes (eyes,
nose, mouth) from splashes, sprays and spatter of body fluids.

A Face Shield is attached to the head with the help of a headband and an elastic strap. The
headband is made from MDF sheets. A transparent clear polyester sheet is used as a shield that
protects the face from any airborne fluid particles. This is secured to the headband as shown in
the photos. Used shields can be removed and replaced with new shields very easily.

During this pandemic of COVID-19, there is an immense shortage of Face shields in the market
which is a must have accessory for our frontline warriors including Police & Healthcare
professionals who are exposed to the COVID positive patients day-in and day-out. Due to their
acute shortage, prices have shot up, exposing these frontline warriors at severe risk.

The Face Shield Project is a collaborative effort by Venture Center Team and group of startup entrepreneurs to design, fabricate and deliver faceshields to the frontline workers.
